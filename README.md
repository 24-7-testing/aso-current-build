This repository doesn’t have a license. This means you do not have permission from the creators of the software to use, modify, or share the software. Although GitHub may allow you to view and fork the code, this does not imply that you are permitted to use, modify, or share the software for any purpose.

Your options:
- If you absolutely want to use our files, ask us nicely to add a license by opening an issue requesting a license and include a link to https://choosealicense.com/. If you’re bold and it’s fairly obvious what license is most appropriate, tell us!
- Don’t use the software. Find or create an alternative that is under an open source license.
